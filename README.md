# Learn Big
Studying code in class is one thing, but to truly learn it, you have to work on projects. The Code Collective is a place for people to develop stronger coding, explore opportunities, and have fun doing it.

To that end, Learn Big is an overarching project that will start at the basics of Python and allow each member to slowly work their way up to a complex and practical application that comes with a host of bragging rights - building your own AI.
Specifically, each member will get some experience with GitHub by cloning this repository, making their own branch, and pushing it back here to origin. This way, you can also see what others are doing for inspiration.
After that, this master branch will be periodically updated with empty scripts to outline the goal of the next step, which can be merged into your branch with a pull request.

## What is the project?
The project will start simple, creating a simple text-based (command-line) interface to enter some data and see the program display it back to you. Some simple number processing will follow, with loops being introduced to make sure you input the right type of data (input validation).

Once the basics of input processing are down, you will write a system to process strings of text as "tokens" to be used further down the line, importing modules to make it easier and more effective.

After your program can process data, you'll need data to process! We will be downloading and using a module called Scweet to scrape Tweets/Xs off of Twitter/X for our program to process and analyze.

Finally, you will use TensorFlow to create and train an AI on the Tweets/Xs to predict the number of likes any given Tweet - even a fake one - might get.

## How long will the project take?
There is no specific time planned for how long Learn Big will take; it's not as rigid as a class, because it's not. This is something to have fun with and learn while doing it.

That being said, it will certainly be a while. This project starts from the beginnings of Python and ends somewhere around the Intermediate/Advanced level of skill. That kind of process takes time, but that's why this project is planned to be the main big thing running central to the club while we also work on plenty of other projects and events.

## What is the inspiration behind Learn Big?
I went into Learn Big with a specific goal in mind: something that started simple, ended complex, covered a lot of topics, was practical and applicable to real programming jobs, and was fun to work on. It was a specific goal, but not a clear nor easy one.

I went through a few ideas, and finally settled on something involving data collection, processing, and training an AI. One of the biggest types of programming jobs is data management, and more and more companies are turning to AI to give them the solutions they want. Besides, who doesn't want to be able to say they made their own AI?

Beyond that, no matter how much I paced in the school's courtyard, I just couldn't quite settle on *what* would actually *be* that data. I talked with a few people, and when someone said 'Tweets', I knew it was right. Being able to build an AI that can process any prompt you give it and tell you how many likes it thinks you'll get it not only fun, but exactly the type of marketing tool these companies want to see.

As for the name Learn Big itself? I needed to come up with a simple name for the repo on the spot and I did my best, okay?
